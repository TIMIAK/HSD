1
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:31,415
Where would you be headin',
little thief?

2
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:33,035
Skellige.

3
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:34,205
Hmm.

4
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:37,916
Do you know how long it is
to the coast?

5
00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:39,788
With a fast horse,

6
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:41,541
about a week.

7
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,420
And what about by foot?

8
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:48,541
You need to be careful, child.

9
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:51,285
This place isn't safe if you're alone.

10
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,250
Then it's the same as every other place.

11
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:48,745
Out of nowhere, you send word to meet you.

12
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:51,331
All this time, I thought you were dead.

13
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:54,996
I told you last time I was in Cintra
that I wasn't coming back.

14
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:56,713
Yet here you are.

15
00:01:58,291 --> 00:01:59,291
Why?

16
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:03,325
You've come for your Child of Surprise...

17
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:04,791
haven't you?

18
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:05,833
The opposite.

19
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:09,536
I want you to tell me that he's safe
and healthy so I can keep on riding.

20
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:10,625
He...

21
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:12,753
is a girl.

22
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:16,083
Yes.

23
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:20,036
Princess Cirilla has been raised
by Calanthe since her parents died.

24
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:21,923
What?

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,580
Pavetta and Duny's ship was lost at sea.

26
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:27,076
Have you been hiding your head
in the sand?

27
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,500
Why now?

28
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:35,666
Why do you think she's not safe?

29
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:39,168
I saw an army making camp
at the Amell Pass.

30
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,080
A sea of black and gold.

31
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:45,963
Nilfgaard is set
on sweeping the Continent.

32
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,381
But since that night at Pavetta's banquet,

33
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:52,578
the Queen's done everything she can
to keep her family safe from threats.

34
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:54,791
Shut the walls.

35
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,035
Fortified the gates.

36
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,290
Sent assassins!

37
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:02,708
What?

38
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,503
Were you followed?

39
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:06,208
No!

40
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:07,456
Hmm.

41
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:57,538
Hmm?

42
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:00,291
Hmm.

43
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,251
You want me, you kill him first!

44
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:16,833
Geralt!

45
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:20,876
Do something!

46
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:23,628
- This is on your Queen.
- We will both die.

47
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:25,503
Blame destiny.

48
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:47,038
The Nilfgaardians don't strike me
as foolish.

49
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:49,541
Coming at us now would be right stupid.

50
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,170
The army whose stink I can smell
on a strong breeze is one I worry about.

51
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,420
So we prepare, same as always.

52
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:01,166
When does the King return from Skellige,
Your Majesty?

53
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:04,130
This morning.
Be good to see that craggy face.

54
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:06,878
Be better to see the 50 ships
the Skelligens promised.

55
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:09,625
Your Majesty.

56
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:11,961
No offense taken, Danek.

57
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:13,916
You know I agree.

58
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:17,496
We've taken on every pissant pretender
for a dozen years.

59
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:20,788
If Nilfgaard need to learn the lesson
the rest of them have,

60
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:22,495
we'll be ready for them.

61
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:25,383
I want reports from the Amell Pass
every hour...

62
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,003
I warned you about coming back.

63
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:39,578
I've been away 12 years
and I'd planned on staying that way...

64
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:41,831
till you sent eight men to kill me.

65
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:47,995
Well, I'm asking you now.

66
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,166
Do not do this.

67
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,960
If you treated me more like a friend
than a threat...

68
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:57,626
Do you know the difference anymore?

69
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:01,416
I'm here

70
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,125
to protect the girl.

71
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:05,711
Who I've raised as my own.

72
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:08,041
Why would I give my only heir

73
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:10,825
to someone who never cared enough
to come back for her?

74
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:14,168
Move along, Witcher.
I'll pay whatever you want.

75
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,790
I can't be bought.

76
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:19,956
You should remember.

77
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:23,081
Money can't undo the Law of Surprise.

78
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:27,791
Kings who've tried to outbid destiny

79
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,455
end up on pikes.

80
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:32,748
And if I win the war but lose Ciri,

81
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:35,165
what victory is that?

82
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:42,288
Maybe that army won't come,
and if they do, maybe you'll be ready.

83
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:45,785
But if you have any doubt in your mind
that she's safe here,

84
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:47,631
give her to me.

85
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:51,288
Call it destiny, security,
what larger forces at work,

86
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:52,706
I don't care.

87
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,580
I will take her, protect her,

88
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,881
and bring her back unharmed,
I promise you that.

89
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:03,631
Ciri is all I have left of my daughter.

90
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,210
If Ciri survives,
then Pavetta lives on too.

91
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:21,708
Law of Surprise has been called.

92
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:24,708
I'll tell Cirilla myself.

93
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,830
Oh, sweet Cintra, you were so promising,

94
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:33,166
from your spoiled princess
to your stupid old king!

95
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,710
But when I arrived,
the royals were dead!

96
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:37,391
Tossed out a window or shot in the head!

97
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:40,168
So, what to do now?
Where's the devil to go?

98
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,500
Anywhere but here. Back in your hole!

99
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,753
No, don't cast me out on a whim!

100
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,833
Who needs you when I've got him?

101
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:07,708
Hey!

102
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:18,376
Where'd you get a piece like this?

103
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:20,628
It was my mother's.

104
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,171
Hey, girl!

105
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:34,128
What's so special about Skellige?

106
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,330
Those roads aren't safe,

107
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:41,746
and the Skelligens are a grumpy lot.

108
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,083
How about this?

109
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:45,458
Come with me.

110
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,455
I've got one more thing to buy.

111
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,833
and then we'll make room
on Clip and Clop

112
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:52,578
and be home by dark.

113
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:57,288
We don't have much,
but we've got a sight more than you do.

114
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:58,375
Roof,

115
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:01,041
food, space on the floor to sleep.

116
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,958
A lot's happening on this Continent,
but we're safer when we stick together.

117
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:08,375
Okay?

118
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:11,333
Grand.

119
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:43,708
It's what has been promised.

120
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:49,541
We must sacrifice... to fulfill destiny.

121
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:55,576
Shh...

122
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:05,575
He may take you,

123
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,421
but you will always be mine.

124
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,920
I need you to be brave now,
because who are you?

125
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,253
The Lion Cub of Cintra.

126
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:31,288
Pleased to meet you, Princess.

127
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:40,001
- Can I say goodbye to my friends now?
- Of course.

128
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:50,128
I'll summon you when she's ready.

129
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:06,671
Go on, Korin, do it!
Oh! Gimme.

130
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:09,963
Korin, Anton, I have to go.

131
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:11,331
- What? No!
- I know!

132
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:14,583
Take care.

133
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:16,458
Your Highness.

134
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:29,035
Throw those knuckles.

135
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:38,633
First, you try to kill me,
then you lie to me.

136
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,878
I'm just trying to keep Cirilla safe.

137
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:46,463
Ciri is safe, with me,
until the day she takes over my throne.

138
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,213
- Listen to me.
- I did listen once.

139
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:51,041
Let a hedgehog into my court.

140
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:53,461
It got me Pavetta dead.

141
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:55,666
I won't lose Ciri too.

142
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,955
So you and destiny
can both fuck right off.

143
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:03,501
Because if Nilfgaard comes,
will destiny carry a banner into battle?

144
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:05,041
No.

145
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,173
We have an army, a navy...

146
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:08,996
and me.

147
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,793
A dynasty can't survive
on arrogance alone.

148
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,205
Says a witcher.

149
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:15,625
She needs family.

150
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,628
You know nothing about that.

151
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:20,378
Your own mother cared so little,
she discarded you.

152
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:25,380
You lecture me on a mother's love
yet offer up someone else's daughter.

153
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:30,461
Queen to all of Cintra,
grandmother to one.

154
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:33,541
I won't orphan that girl.

155
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,285
You're sentencing her to death.

156
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,376
- What did I miss?
- Nothing.

157
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,333
Get him out of my sight.

158
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:45,961
I remember
when you honored the Law of Surprise.

159
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,830
What changed?

160
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:49,166
I had a granddaughter.

161
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,460
So protect her.

162
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:53,041
- Your Majesty.
- What if Calanthe's wrong?

163
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,496
What if they come and Ciri is trapped?

164
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,713
I fight side by side with my Queen.

165
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,625
You put too much faith in that woman.

166
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:02,128
Well, you weren't there.

167
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:07,710
After Pavetta died, Calanthe would
wake up howling in the night.

168
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:11,788
The Lioness, nearly broken.

169
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:14,665
Someone who's able to pull themselves
out of that,

170
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,080
they'll have my confidence
till my final day.

171
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:25,748
I need your promise you won't come back.

172
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:30,826
If I hear Ciri's in danger,

173
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,580
you know I can't do that.

174
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:38,791
I know.

175
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:51,878
Just move it!

176
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,210
Faster!

177
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,830
That's right!
No water till you've finished!

178
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:02,285
Move it!

179
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:05,378
That's right!

180
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:09,753
All right, ditch diggers!

181
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:10,833
Move it!

182
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:21,708
Report any findings immediately!

183
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:27,038
All visitors must declare themselves
to the officers!

184
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,750
Is it cleared yet?

185
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:31,421
Safe conduct?

186
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,120
You're coming from Caingorn?

187
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,080
How long will you be in Nazair?

188
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,000
That is yet to be determined.

189
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,375
Hello, Yennefer.

190
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:06,206
The... the runes described a...

191
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:10,131
a "magnalith" in Nazair,
but no one could find it till I got here.

192
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:13,705
Until Nilfgaard tore
through all the lands.

193
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,880
They allow my research.

194
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,041
That's all I care about.

195
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:21,245
Hmm. A man of principle.

196
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:26,791
You don't understand.
Every glyph has a clue

197
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:28,726
to something across the Continent...

198
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,710
...from a time before the Conjunction.

199
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:33,331
Most are history, but some might be more.

200
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:36,166
The prophecy, the future,
I want to explore all of it.

201
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,581
Wow.

202
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:44,083
That's a face. You hate it that much?

203
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:45,806
Only because I have taste buds.

204
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:48,626
Well, these people were starving
before Nilfgaard.

205
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,535
See, most kings only care
about their cocks and their coffers.

206
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:55,923
They look out for their people.
Everybody gets something.

207
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,170
The same thing,

208
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,833
which tastes as if someone pissed
in my cup.

209
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,710
Sounds to me like you bought in.

210
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:06,831
No. No, it's, uh...

211
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:09,333
It's just that...

212
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,630
sometimes, boring is better.

213
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:16,875
No, it's not.

214
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:22,708
Come on.

215
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,705
How long do you see yourself here?

216
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:35,206
There's a lot of hill left to dig. Why?

217
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:40,746
Because I may be missing you.

218
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:47,286
See, the Yennefer I remember
didn't miss anyone.

219
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:48,535
Yeah, well...

220
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:56,078
What if...

221
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,000
it's not too late
for what we talked about in the cave?

222
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,286
We could go somewhere with,

223
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:07,418
I don't know, two types of ale.

224
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:09,041
You could...

225
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,001
play with your rocks,

226
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:13,461
and I'll work as a mage.

227
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:16,328
You hate monoliths.

228
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:17,786
- Yes, but...
- But what?

229
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:22,171
I mean, look at you.
You could have anyone.

230
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:23,666
I have.

231
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:26,705
And it was fun to be wanted.

232
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:29,751
The object of desire.

233
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:33,083
After where I came from, I lapped it up.

234
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:40,496
But they all loved the power
that came with my position at court.

235
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,920
Not my power.

236
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,790
And no one's ever seen that but me?

237
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:22,916
You know,

238
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:24,625
I spent...

239
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,418
I spent years...

240
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:32,041
waiting for this moment where
you realized we're meant for each other.

241
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,130
You know, coming up with excuses
to study at Aedirn.

242
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:42,326
Henges, dead languages, anything
to get closer to you again, and....

243
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,958
every request I made was denied.

244
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:52,788
You shut them all down.

245
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,628
Stregobor, of all people,
snapped me out of it.

246
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:08,583
"Forget about the girl.
Get back to work." And work saved me.

247
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:13,208
Remembered why I loved it.
The beauty, the purity. No...

248
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:17,708
distractions when I'm in it.

249
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:23,583
You went after the thing you loved.

250
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:27,788
So you chose power.

251
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:43,251
At least you kept your eyes.

252
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:02,125
His loss.

253
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:03,625
Piss off.

254
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:06,956
Well, I would,
but we don't have much time.

255
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:08,211
Who the fuck are you?

256
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,633
I'm Vilgefortz of Roggeveen.

257
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:13,791
Why are you whispering?

258
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:23,666
Nilfgaard is conscripting mages
like us into their service.

259
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,920
Now, since...

260
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:30,043
Now, since I don't have a letter
of safe conduct,

261
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:33,165
and yours is probably fake, we should go,

262
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:35,881
before those lads start asking questions.

263
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:36,958
Go where?

264
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:40,333
Aretuza.

265
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,790
Well, the feeling's mutual.

266
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:47,575
The Chapter thinks you're rash,

267
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:49,746
unpredictable and dangerous.

268
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:51,831
But right now,

269
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:55,041
that's exactly what Tissaia and I need.

270
00:21:58,458 --> 00:21:59,748
Tissaia asked for me?

271
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:04,666
She said you're the best student
she ever taught.

272
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:38,168
Let's talk.

273
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,080
About what?

274
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:40,166
Nilfgaard.

275
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:44,293
Their army's camped near Cintra,
and we think they're going to attack.

276
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:45,825
And they won't stop there.

277
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:47,996
We need allies
from the Northern Kingdoms.

278
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:51,463
I'll leave this to the people
who actually give a shit. Where's Tissaia?

279
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:53,075
Tissaia can wait.

280
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:55,705
Fine, I'll just follow the sound
of crying girls.

281
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,501
She has no idea you're here.

282
00:23:00,541 --> 00:23:01,921
You said she asked for me.

283
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
No.

284
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,170
I told you that she said
you were her best student.

285
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,750
I'm the one that wants you here.

286
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,330
It took five minutes
for the lies to start.

287
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:15,876
Why did I expect anything else
from a place held together by bullshit?

288
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:27,541
Do you know how many
people wouldn't blink if you died?

289
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:34,208
Let me out!

290
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:35,421
Let me out!

291
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:45,125
Sometimes, the best thing
a flower can do for us is die.

292
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:49,665
You should've let me die.

293
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,580
At least I had control over that.

294
00:23:52,541 --> 00:23:55,081
Mm, that's adorable, piglet.

295
00:23:57,458 --> 00:23:58,938
You weren't taking control,

296
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:01,075
you were losing it.

297
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:04,628
- You were losing it.
- What the hell's going on in here?

298
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:07,955
We were studying. Botany.

299
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:15,878
If I gave Rectress de Vries your pitiful
excuse about that pitiful plant,

300
00:24:16,416 --> 00:24:17,876
I'd be gone by nightfall.

301
00:24:23,416 --> 00:24:25,376
But fuck that old bag!

302
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,210
This was my room.

303
00:24:34,791 --> 00:24:36,421
Before anyone you know was born.

304
00:24:37,416 --> 00:24:38,666
So, you've been to court?

305
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:44,958
Aedirn.

306
00:24:49,375 --> 00:24:50,495
It's very elegant.

307
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:53,875
- Very boring.
- Why are you back, then?

308
00:24:55,958 --> 00:24:57,078
Why am I back?

309
00:25:24,166 --> 00:25:26,376
I bet you hate botany as much as I did.

310
00:25:34,541 --> 00:25:37,251
Who wants to know
what those herbs are really good for?

311
00:25:47,708 --> 00:25:49,788
Rhwydwaith carthion.

312
00:25:50,791 --> 00:25:53,331
They've taught you
about its healing powers

313
00:25:53,416 --> 00:25:54,826
and fortifying blah, blah, blah.

314
00:25:55,291 --> 00:25:58,881
But they leave out
that if you mix these two together,

315
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:01,543
you'll see colors like never...

316
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:03,750
before.

317
00:26:04,791 --> 00:26:07,041
Miss tells us never to mix herbs.

318
00:26:09,166 --> 00:26:12,036
They tell you that so you have to go
to them for all the answers.

319
00:26:12,875 --> 00:26:14,205
A word of advice.

320
00:26:14,916 --> 00:26:16,786
Think for yourselves.

321
00:26:18,916 --> 00:26:20,996
It'll save you a lifetime of heartbreak.

322
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,960
The ceiling's melting.

323
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:25,456
No.

324
00:26:25,541 --> 00:26:26,921
The herbs are working.

325
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,130
Well, I don't feel...

326
00:26:30,208 --> 00:26:32,208
What was I saying?

327
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:34,580
Gods, you're pretty.

328
00:26:36,958 --> 00:26:38,168
Oh, don't worry, Fola.

329
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,920
You'll look like that too.

330
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Nobody starts off that way.

331
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:45,173
- You want to know a secret?
- Nobody starts off that way.

332
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:46,250
It's overrated.

333
00:26:48,041 --> 00:26:49,631
Look, I'm levitating!

334
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:51,188
Levitating, I'm levitating.

335
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:54,630
Glacella, whatever you lack
in talent, you make up for in confidence.

336
00:26:54,708 --> 00:26:57,351
She doesn't need confidence.
Her father owns half of Creyden.

337
00:26:57,375 --> 00:26:59,785
So he could swap a hundred horses
for her spot here.

338
00:27:04,041 --> 00:27:06,461
Your parents paid Aretuza?

339
00:27:08,916 --> 00:27:11,786
The Chapter decided it needed students
from the best families.

340
00:27:13,291 --> 00:27:15,541
But you all must have had
a conduit moment?

341
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,790
We shouldn't be mixing herbs.
We shouldn't even be here.

342
00:27:22,916 --> 00:27:25,666
You know, if they catch us,
they really will expel us.

343
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,710
There are far worse things than expulsion.

344
00:27:30,666 --> 00:27:31,666
Like what?

345
00:27:50,541 --> 00:27:52,001
What is this place?

346
00:27:52,083 --> 00:27:53,423
Aretuza's windmill.

347
00:27:54,166 --> 00:27:56,666
Enough bridled chaos
to keep the curtains hung...

348
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:59,878
and the torches lit,
but that's not what we're here for.

349
00:28:03,416 --> 00:28:06,996
- I think we should go.
- Wait. I've got so many questions.

350
00:28:08,833 --> 00:28:10,543
You want to know more.

351
00:28:10,625 --> 00:28:11,625
Yes.

352
00:28:12,666 --> 00:28:13,666
Everything.

353
00:28:22,583 --> 00:28:24,713
The ability to create life,

354
00:28:26,375 --> 00:28:27,535
real life,

355
00:28:30,791 --> 00:28:32,461
they take that from you.

356
00:28:36,666 --> 00:28:38,076
And then send you out,

357
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,580
so the only family,
the only loyalty you have,

358
00:28:41,666 --> 00:28:42,666
is to them.

359
00:28:45,083 --> 00:28:46,583
And you'll trade it all for what?

360
00:28:48,375 --> 00:28:49,705
Looks that never change.

361
00:28:50,916 --> 00:28:52,376
A court full of idiots.

362
00:28:55,958 --> 00:28:57,498
But you don't have to do it.

363
00:28:57,916 --> 00:28:59,036
But what if I want to?

364
00:28:59,583 --> 00:29:01,963
- We're leaving. Come on.
- Lesson's not over yet!

365
00:29:02,041 --> 00:29:03,961
Just because you fucked up,
doesn't mean we will.

366
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,580
- You?
- Come on.

367
00:29:05,666 --> 00:29:07,576
With all the magical talent
of shoe leather?

368
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,580
You'll have a home here forever,
Glacella.

369
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:15,380
Right here.

370
00:29:17,166 --> 00:29:19,286
With my sisters who never ascended.

371
00:29:23,916 --> 00:29:25,036
What's happening?

372
00:29:30,541 --> 00:29:31,751
Anica, is that you?

373
00:29:33,875 --> 00:29:36,075
You turned my friend into a slug.

374
00:29:36,166 --> 00:29:37,706
An eel.

375
00:29:39,041 --> 00:29:41,291
Come, push your friend into the pool.

376
00:29:43,708 --> 00:29:46,498
I don't care what you do,
but remember this.

377
00:29:46,583 --> 00:29:48,503
Even if you do everything right,

378
00:29:48,583 --> 00:29:50,043
follow their rules,

379
00:29:50,125 --> 00:29:52,495
that's still no guarantee
you'll get what you want.

380
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:53,673
Enough!

381
00:29:55,125 --> 00:29:56,665
Back to your rooms, girls.

382
00:30:08,333 --> 00:30:09,583
You ruined one life.

383
00:30:11,291 --> 00:30:12,291
Stop there.

384
00:30:21,708 --> 00:30:23,628
I never even wanted to come back here!

385
00:30:24,625 --> 00:30:27,575
Then you failed at that, too.

386
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:29,460
Look at this place.

387
00:30:30,291 --> 00:30:31,331
It's a joke.

388
00:30:32,791 --> 00:30:34,921
Letting in girls who can't even do magic!

389
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:38,126
Sometimes, you have to compromise
in order to survive.

390
00:30:38,625 --> 00:30:42,035
You say I never took responsibility
for the way my life turned out.

391
00:30:42,125 --> 00:30:43,125
What about you?

392
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,710
But what's happening?
I don't understand...

393
00:30:45,791 --> 00:30:47,041
What's going on?

394
00:30:47,125 --> 00:30:48,165
It's happening.

395
00:30:50,625 --> 00:30:51,625
Triss!

396
00:30:53,833 --> 00:30:54,833
Yennefer.

397
00:30:55,625 --> 00:30:58,165
- I tried finding you for years.
- Why are you all here?

398
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:00,540
An emergency conclave
of the Northern Mages.

399
00:31:01,041 --> 00:31:03,581
- Nilfgaard took Marnadal.
- What?

400
00:31:03,666 --> 00:31:04,996
They're attacking Cintra.

401
00:31:06,041 --> 00:31:09,081
Going to war against Nilfgaard
is madness.

402
00:31:09,166 --> 00:31:10,286
And for Cintra?

403
00:31:11,291 --> 00:31:15,461
They've rejected our mages for decades,
so let's grant them their wish.

404
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:17,171
It's not just about Cintra.

405
00:31:17,916 --> 00:31:20,746
Nilfgaard won't be satisfied
until they have the whole Continent.

406
00:31:20,833 --> 00:31:24,003
- And how do you know this?
- Because that's the same lie I would tell.

407
00:31:24,375 --> 00:31:26,495
I'm the only one here
that's led soldiers into battle.

408
00:31:26,541 --> 00:31:28,081
Oh, yes, and don't we know it?

409
00:31:28,166 --> 00:31:29,496
You wear your silly costume

410
00:31:29,583 --> 00:31:31,103
every chance you get.

411
00:31:31,166 --> 00:31:36,326
All those years swinging his sword around
were years he wasn't serving as a mage.

412
00:31:36,416 --> 00:31:39,376
Or killing babies born at an eclipse.

413
00:31:41,916 --> 00:31:46,326
We can stop Nilfgaard, if we act now.

414
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:49,580
The south... well, is the south.

415
00:31:49,666 --> 00:31:51,666
It is up to the north to unite.

416
00:31:52,041 --> 00:31:55,711
It is time to convince our kings
to send their armies.

417
00:31:55,791 --> 00:31:56,911
They could cross the Yaruga,

418
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:59,633
make it to Sodden by week's end.

419
00:31:59,708 --> 00:32:00,708
They could save Cintra.

420
00:32:00,791 --> 00:32:02,631
If Cintra falls, who cares?

421
00:32:02,708 --> 00:32:03,918
I care!

422
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,080
Because our kingdoms will be next.

423
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:12,460
Our fight is with Cintra, and only Cintra.

424
00:32:13,916 --> 00:32:17,166
In Nilfgaard, we know what it's like
to have corrupt leaders.

425
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:21,130
But under our new leader,
Emperor Emhyr, we've changed.

426
00:32:21,958 --> 00:32:23,628
We've strengthened trade.

427
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:24,828
We've funded research.

428
00:32:24,916 --> 00:32:26,576
We have torn down walls,

429
00:32:26,666 --> 00:32:29,746
whilst Queen Calanthe has done nothing
but put them up.

430
00:32:29,833 --> 00:32:32,883
I am not here to defend Cintra.

431
00:32:33,875 --> 00:32:36,205
But I will defend our way of life.

432
00:32:36,916 --> 00:32:39,166
The Brotherhood, the Academies,

433
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:42,670
the order that we have built up
over centuries.

434
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:45,130
You've rejected it all, Fringilla.

435
00:32:45,208 --> 00:32:47,498
Not true. We've modified it.

436
00:32:47,583 --> 00:32:49,713
Most of us came from Aretuza
and Ban Ard.

437
00:32:49,791 --> 00:32:52,211
We've simply charted a different path,

438
00:32:52,291 --> 00:32:53,671
guided by the White Flame.

439
00:32:54,208 --> 00:32:56,208
That makes us cousins, not enemies.

440
00:32:56,291 --> 00:32:58,421
You force mages into servitude!

441
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:01,210
When in training, yes.
Like soldiers.

442
00:33:01,291 --> 00:33:03,041
We believe in shared sacrifice.

443
00:33:03,125 --> 00:33:04,955
You also believe
in forbidden magic.

444
00:33:05,041 --> 00:33:07,171
Demonology, necromancy, fire magic!

445
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:10,880
Forbidden magic is one
of the ghost stories taught to us here.

446
00:33:10,958 --> 00:33:13,788
There is no such thing as dark
or light magic.

447
00:33:14,791 --> 00:33:17,041
Nothing in this world is
as simple as that.

448
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:21,540
You think
that we're destroying the Continent.

449
00:33:22,416 --> 00:33:26,826
We know that if we take Cintra,
we have a chance of saving it.

450
00:33:28,583 --> 00:33:32,883
If you won't take sides,
then at least stay out of our way.

451
00:33:36,416 --> 00:33:39,286
Ah, enough
of this tiring debate.

452
00:33:39,375 --> 00:33:40,995
Cintra's a lost cause.

453
00:33:41,083 --> 00:33:42,583
Let them reap what they sow.

454
00:33:42,666 --> 00:33:43,576
I say we vote.

455
00:33:43,666 --> 00:33:45,206
- Yes, vote. Vote!
- Vote?

456
00:33:46,208 --> 00:33:48,128
First, you install
your niece at Nilfgaard,

457
00:33:48,208 --> 00:33:49,788
and now you want to ram through a vote.

458
00:33:49,875 --> 00:33:51,705
To be fair,
Yennefer of Vengerberg

459
00:33:51,791 --> 00:33:53,921
is the one I have to thank for my posting.

460
00:33:55,375 --> 00:33:58,125
If she had taken it,
I wouldn't be where I am today.

461
00:33:58,208 --> 00:33:59,418
Neither would Nilfgaard.

462
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,710
If only Yennefer had gone to Nilfgaard.

463
00:34:01,791 --> 00:34:04,631
With her at the helm,
they'd still be a shitty backwater.

464
00:34:06,583 --> 00:34:07,583
You're right.

465
00:34:08,916 --> 00:34:12,706
Instead, I went to a prized kingdom
and did fuck all for decades.

466
00:34:12,791 --> 00:34:14,171
Just as you taught us.

467
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,830
Helped murderers and rapists
keep their crown.

468
00:34:18,708 --> 00:34:20,458
Maybe it is time for something different.

469
00:34:20,541 --> 00:34:22,631
Pipe down. You... you don't get a vote.

470
00:34:22,708 --> 00:34:24,378
If I did, I'd vote to burn it all down.

471
00:34:24,458 --> 00:34:25,976
There! There you have...

472
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,130
- There you have it!
- It's true.

473
00:34:28,208 --> 00:34:31,288
Cintra has chosen to turn its back on us.

474
00:34:32,708 --> 00:34:35,208
They are proud, and smart,
and difficult, yes.

475
00:34:36,083 --> 00:34:38,003
But I'd wager above all else...

476
00:34:39,083 --> 00:34:40,673
- they are scared.
- It's true.

477
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:44,500
We have called them a lost cause
for years.

478
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:47,173
But we stopped trying too.

479
00:34:47,625 --> 00:34:49,325
And it is time now...

480
00:34:49,791 --> 00:34:52,791
that we risk not only our lives,
but our pride,

481
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:54,920
and try again.

482
00:35:06,083 --> 00:35:07,213
With your permission,

483
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:09,670
all those in favor

484
00:35:10,416 --> 00:35:13,576
of letting Cintra continue
their proud tradition

485
00:35:13,666 --> 00:35:15,536
of fending for themselves?

486
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:30,750
Well...

487
00:35:32,416 --> 00:35:33,746
there you have it.

488
00:35:37,625 --> 00:35:40,785
I know you hate this place,
but there are girls who need it.

489
00:35:41,708 --> 00:35:45,208
Those who have only ever known chaos
until we teach them control.

490
00:35:47,458 --> 00:35:49,288
You were right, in Rinde.

491
00:35:51,083 --> 00:35:52,883
Aretuza is all I have.

492
00:35:55,541 --> 00:35:57,041
If Nilfgaard wins...

493
00:36:06,083 --> 00:36:09,383
That's why Vilgefortz and I
and some others are going to fight.

494
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,080
You should join us.

495
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,380
Did you hear a word I just said?

496
00:36:15,833 --> 00:36:17,333
Why would I protect this?

497
00:36:18,666 --> 00:36:22,576
If you will not do it for the Brotherhood,
then do it for me.

498
00:36:25,208 --> 00:36:26,208
Please.

499
00:36:36,125 --> 00:36:37,955
Have you ever used that word before?

500
00:36:41,375 --> 00:36:42,455
Your Majesty,

501
00:36:42,541 --> 00:36:44,671
the Nilfgaardians will breach
the castle gates.

502
00:36:47,125 --> 00:36:48,165
Have breached.

503
00:36:48,541 --> 00:36:49,751
Now what?

504
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:51,293
What do we do?

505
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,540
Hmm.

506
00:37:26,708 --> 00:37:27,708
The Witcher...

507
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:34,540
I couldn't let him go.

508
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:38,000
I know what I've done.

509
00:37:41,083 --> 00:37:42,423
He's in the gate keep.

510
00:37:48,375 --> 00:37:49,915
If I can bring him here...

511
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:51,750
to Ciri...

512
00:37:53,125 --> 00:37:55,875
destiny may yet side with us.

513
00:38:00,875 --> 00:38:01,875
Danek.

514
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:05,750
It's time.

515
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,460
Wait, where are you going?

516
00:38:22,583 --> 00:38:23,583
Geralt!

517
00:38:45,166 --> 00:38:46,166
Your Majesty...

518
00:38:50,708 --> 00:38:51,708
He's gone.

519
00:38:52,291 --> 00:38:54,041
Looks like he's escaped.

520
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:57,168
If he is out there,

521
00:38:58,166 --> 00:39:00,126
then there is still hope for her.

522
00:39:01,875 --> 00:39:04,875
- What is it?
- Lazlo, bring her cloak.

523
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:08,250
What? No!

524
00:39:09,541 --> 00:39:11,921
Continue to be brave. Promise me.

525
00:39:12,375 --> 00:39:14,455
You are the Lion Cub of Cintra.

526
00:39:14,541 --> 00:39:17,181
- You are destined for great things.
- I can't do this without you.

527
00:39:17,208 --> 00:39:19,788
- We must go, Your Highness.
- No!

528
00:39:26,375 --> 00:39:27,375
Go.

529
00:39:28,958 --> 00:39:30,458
The world depends on it.

530
00:39:35,458 --> 00:39:36,668
I love you.

531
00:39:40,791 --> 00:39:43,131
Find Geralt of Rivia.

532
00:39:44,875 --> 00:39:46,575
He is your destiny.

533
00:39:49,458 --> 00:39:50,818
We must go, Your Highness.

534
00:40:54,458 --> 00:40:55,458
Princess, come.

535
00:41:15,833 --> 00:41:18,003
Tell me what I want to know
and you'll live.

536
00:41:21,666 --> 00:41:23,246
I am already saved.

537
00:41:39,625 --> 00:41:40,705
Where is Cirilla?

538
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:44,881
No one... is left.

539
00:41:47,166 --> 00:41:49,666
Ah... we shall be born anew.

540
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:51,130
Thus it shall be.

541
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:52,538
Watch for the signs.

542
00:41:52,625 --> 00:41:54,875
What signs these shall be I say unto...

543
00:42:10,125 --> 00:42:12,075
I should've traded that ring for food.

544
00:42:14,041 --> 00:42:15,081
You're right, Clop.

545
00:42:16,125 --> 00:42:17,205
Or are you Clip?

546
00:42:19,166 --> 00:42:22,416
Gods, what kind of crazy person
talks to a horse?

547
00:43:01,291 --> 00:43:02,291
It's all right.

548
00:43:04,875 --> 00:43:06,245
It's all right. We're Cintrans.

549
00:43:08,375 --> 00:43:09,375
Anton!

550
00:43:09,916 --> 00:43:12,326
You made it out. You're all right!

551
00:43:12,416 --> 00:43:14,246
I told you it was her at the market.

552
00:43:15,833 --> 00:43:16,833
Hey.

553
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:19,130
What are you doing?

554
00:43:19,833 --> 00:43:21,083
Hey, stop that!

555
00:43:21,166 --> 00:43:22,786
Anton. Please, stop it!

556
00:43:22,875 --> 00:43:25,245
You don't give the orders anymore,
Princess.

557
00:43:25,333 --> 00:43:27,883
Rumor is Nilfgaard's looking for you.

558
00:43:29,166 --> 00:43:31,376
And willing to pay a barrel of orens, too.

559
00:43:32,083 --> 00:43:33,633
I'm sorry for what happened.

560
00:43:35,333 --> 00:43:37,133
I'm sorry if your family got hurt.

561
00:43:39,875 --> 00:43:41,625
We played knucklebones together.

562
00:43:42,291 --> 00:43:44,041
This isn't you. I know it.

563
00:43:45,416 --> 00:43:46,456
You know fuck all.

564
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,535
You thought you were better than us
because we had to let you win?

565
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,500
The only thing special about you
was the fucking crown on your head.

566
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:56,833
No!

567
00:43:57,333 --> 00:43:59,083
No!

568
00:43:59,791 --> 00:44:00,791
I...

569
00:44:16,375 --> 00:44:18,075
Verily, I say unto you

570
00:44:18,166 --> 00:44:20,996
the era of the sword and the ax is nigh,

571
00:44:21,083 --> 00:44:22,923
the era of the Wolf's Blizzard.

572
00:44:23,375 --> 00:44:26,705
The Time of the White Chill
and the White Light is nigh...

573
00:44:27,708 --> 00:44:30,748
...the Time of Madness
and the Time of Contempt.
